# Recipe Generator

A React app recipe generator that retrieves recipes from an OpenAI-powered assistant in JSON format and fetches relevant images from Unsplash. Users can explore various recipes, view images based on recipe titles, and save their favorite recipes locally. The app utilizes Redux Toolkit with persistor for state management and local storage data optimizations.

## Features

- **Generate Recipes**: Recipes are fetched from a custom OpenAI assistant in JSON format, with details such as title, ingredients, and instructions.
- **Fetch Recipe Images**: Images for each recipe are fetched from Unsplash based on the recipe title.
- **Local Storage Optimization**: Viewed images are cached in local storage to avoid repeated API calls.
- **Save Favorite Recipes**: Users can save recipes locally for later reference.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit is used for managing the app's state.
